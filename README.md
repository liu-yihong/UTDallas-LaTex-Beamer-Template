### About Institutional Marks

This template can display UT Dallas institutional marks at the cover page or every slide. To enable this function, users must consult [the University](https://brand.utdallas.edu/graphics-visual-identity/institutional-marks/) and download the marks into the folder [includes/pics](includes/pics). Then users can activate the mark display by commenting out the scripts in the [logo.tex](includes/tex/logo.tex) file (found in [includes/tex](includes/tex)).

The University of Texas at Dallas logos are for non-commercial and internal University use. Any use of these logos for sponsorships, partnerships or commercial purposes requires approval by the Office of Communications and proof of contractual agreement to use the University marks before being produced.
